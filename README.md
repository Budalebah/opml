# OPML: OPtimistic Machine Learning on Blockchain

OPML enables off-chain AI model inference using optimistic approach with an on chain interactive dispute engine implementing fault proofs.

For more in-depth information, refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/hyperoracle/opml/wiki).

You can also find a tutorial on building a straightforward handwritten digit recognition DNN model (MNIST) within OPML in the [`docs/tutorial.md`](docs/tutorial.md).

## Building

Pre-requisites: Go (Go 1.19), Node.js, Make, and CMake.

```
git clone https://github.com/ora-io/opml.git --recursive

make build
```

## Examples

The script files [`demo/challenge_simple.sh`](demo/challenge_simple.sh) presents an example scenario (a DNN model for MNIST) demonstrating the whole process of a fault proof, including the challenge game and single step verification.

To test the example, we should first start a local node:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Then we can run:

```shell
bash ./demo/challenge_simple.sh
```

A large language model, the llama example is provided in the branch ["llama"](https://github.com/hyperoracle/opml/tree/llama) (It also works for llama 2).
